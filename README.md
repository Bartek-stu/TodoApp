# ü¶Ä Todo App based on Azure infrastructure ü¶Ä
## Building
Binary:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

Docker image:
```
docker buildx build -t todo_app:latest . --push your_docker_hub_account/todo_app:latest
```

## Setting up infrastructure
By default configuration uses image of the application which is stored in on my Docker Hub account.
If you want to use your own image, you need to build it and push it to your own Docker Hub account.
Then you need to change the `app_image_name` in `infra/variables.tf` file.
```bash
cd infra && terraform init && terraform apply
```

## Infrastructure description
Project is using Azure infrastructre. It consists of following resources:
# üì¶ Azure Infrastructure Overview
